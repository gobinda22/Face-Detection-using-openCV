# Face-Detection-using-openCV

# openCV
OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages like Python, C++, Java, etc. It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human. When it is integrated with various libraries, such as Numpy which is a highly optimized library for numerical operations, then the number of weapons increases in your Arsenal i.e whatever operations one can do in Numpy can be combined with OpenCV.

# Haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
In this use-case we will try to detect the face of individuals using the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
